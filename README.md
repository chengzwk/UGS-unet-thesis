<h1> Park-NET: identifying Urban parks using multi source spatial data and Geo-AI </h1>

This is a master thesis project done by Marta Kozłowska and Jiawei Zhao for ‘Applied Data Science programme at Utrecht University. We have a goal of analysing to what extent can a reproducible CNN model that predicts urban greenspace based on open source be created. The process involved creating two CNN models. One was the U-Net model built from scratch, and the other was the U-Net with ResNet34/50 encoder to make use of the transfer learning approach.

Go to our separate folder to see which methods exactly we used and what results we got.
